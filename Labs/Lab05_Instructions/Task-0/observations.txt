Analysis of time Command Output for Different Programs

The time command measures real, user, and system time, giving insight into how different execution patterns impact performance.

Key Metrics
	‚Ä¢	Real time (real) ‚Üí Actual elapsed time (wall-clock time).
	‚Ä¢	User time (user) ‚Üí CPU time spent executing user-space code.
	‚Ä¢	System time (sys) ‚Üí CPU time spent executing system calls (e.g., malloc(), sleep()).

1Ô∏è‚É£ regularcode (Single-threaded Computation)

real	0m2.683s
user	0m2.671s
sys	0m0.018s

‚úÖ Observations:
	‚Ä¢	user ‚âà real ‚Üí Almost all time is spent on computation.
	‚Ä¢	sys is minimal ‚Üí Few system calls.

üí° Conclusion:
This program is a pure CPU-bound computation, where execution time is dictated by processing speed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ mallocycode (Memory Allocation Heavy)

real	0m3.687s
user	0m3.201s
sys	0m0.492s

‚úÖ Observations:
	‚Ä¢	Higher sys time (0.492s vs 0.018s in regularcode) ‚Üí More system calls due to dynamic memory allocations (malloc(), free()).
	‚Ä¢	Increased real time ‚Üí Memory allocations might introduce cache misses, page faults, or slow memory management.

üí° Conclusion:
The performance overhead comes from frequent memory allocations, causing more kernel interactions (syscalls) and memory management overhead.

3Ô∏è‚É£ sleepycode (Calls sleep())

real	0m7.699s
user	0m2.684s
sys	0m0.014s

‚úÖ Observations:
	‚Ä¢	real time is much higher (7.699s vs user=2.684s) ‚Üí Due to explicit sleep() calls.
	‚Ä¢	Low sys time ‚Üí sleep() is a lightweight system call.

üí° Conclusion:
The program pauses execution intentionally. During sleep(), the CPU is idle, and the process is not consuming CPU cycles, explaining the large gap between real and user time.

4Ô∏è‚É£ threadedcode (Multithreaded Computation)

real	0m2.683s
user	0m5.342s
sys	0m0.005s

‚úÖ Observations:
	‚Ä¢	user time is nearly doubled (5.342s) compared to real (2.683s) ‚Üí This suggests two threads are running in parallel.
	‚Ä¢	real time is similar to regularcode ‚Üí Parallel execution speeds up the program.

üí° Conclusion:
	‚Ä¢	The work is being split across two CPU cores.
	‚Ä¢	Since multiple threads run simultaneously, total CPU usage (user) is higher, but the wall-clock (real) time remains low.

Final Takeaways

Code	real (Wall-Clock)	user (CPU Computation)	sys (Kernel/System Calls)	Behavior
regularcode	2.683s	2.671s	0.018s	CPU-bound single-threaded computation
mallocycode	3.687s	3.201s	0.492s	Heavy memory allocations (increased sys time)
sleepycode	7.699s	2.684s	0.014s	Calls sleep(), causing idle time
threadedcode	2.683s	5.342s	0.005s	Multithreading utilizes multiple CPU cores

üöÄ Insights
	‚Ä¢	regularcode is CPU-bound and efficient.
	‚Ä¢	mallocycode suffers from memory allocation overhead.
	‚Ä¢	sleepycode has a long real time due to forced delays.
	‚Ä¢	threadedcode effectively uses multiple CPU cores.
